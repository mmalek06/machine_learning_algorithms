## The why
The purpose of this repo is documenting my self-study of Machine Learning. I find it easier to remember new concepts 
if I have to explain them to someone, so I decided to do it here for people like me - hopelessly going through numerous
online ML courses that speed through the math or don't mention it at all. At one moment I got quite annoyed, because 
I didn't want to use all those ML libs like books full of magic spells - not knowing what they actually do "under the hood". 
So here you go. In those notebooks I try to integrate knowledge found in numerous places - books, blogs, SO and so on. <br />
Materials that got me going:
1. [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.pl/Mathematics-Machine-Learning-Peter-Deisenroth/dp/110845514X/ref=asc_df_110845514X/?tag=plshogostdde-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=504294727344&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=373942613087480818&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067589&hvtargid=pla-898490796899&psc=1)
2. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow](https://www.amazon.pl/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-Tensorflow/dp/1492032646/ref=asc_df_1492032646/?tag=plshogostdde-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=504523906021&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15920467028215595469&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067589&hvtargid=pla-523968811896&psc=1)

Also - some code fragments may look familiar, and they should because I copied and pasted some of them from 
various blogs (probably towardsdatascience and Medium) and StackOverflow posts. While creating those notebooks I was focusing
on understanding those concepts and code while learning with hundreds of browser tabs open. Some of the content here
is purely mine, some is not. At some point the time came and I realized I didn't save the links to other people's work. 
So in case you get lost in the internet and somehow came to this github repo AND you're an author of such a post -
I'm not stealing your work, I just couldn't remember where did it come from. Let me know, and I'll insert links to your 
article into my work.
<br /> <br />
But anyway, my purpose for this repo is not to get the Nobel Prize, but only to understand ML better while at the same
time try to help other people :)

## The how
Each notebook is an implementation of a widely known ML algorithm - from scratch, 
so using only basic python, numpy and matplotlib for visualizations. There's a whole lot
of math there and since I'm just a software engineer, not a mathematician, my explanations may not be
strict enough - mathematically speaking. Also, I try to go as deep, as I can, however since I'm just a programmer
I may be wrong in some places. When in doubt consult your local math professor.<br />
If you'd like to follow along some basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus is required.
