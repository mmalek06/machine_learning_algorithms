## The why
The purpose of this repo is documenting my self-study of Machine Learning. I find it easier to remember new concepts 
if I have to explain them to someone, so I decided to do it here for people like me - hopelessly going through numerous
online ML courses that speed through the math or don't mention it at all. At one moment I got quite annoyed, because 
I didn't want to use all those ML libs like books full of magic spells - not knowing what they actually do "under the hood". 
So here you go. In those notebooks I try to integrate knowledge found in numerous
places - books, blogs, SO and so on. <br />

## The how
Each notebook is an implementation of a widely known ML algorithm - from scratch, 
so using only basic python, numpy and matplotlib for visualizations. There's a whole lot
of math there and since I'm just a software engineer, not a mathematician, my explanations may not be
strict enough - mathematically speaking. Also, I try to go as deep, as I can, however since I'm just a programmer
I may be wrong in some places. When in doubt consult your local math professor.<br />
If you'd like to follow along some basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus is required.
